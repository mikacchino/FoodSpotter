# FoodSpotter
A web application that can identify foodstuffs (70 classes). Made with HTML, CSS, JS, Python.
Allegedly, it has an accuracy of 46.497%. I'm not too sure about that, since it keeps thinking things are miso soup. 
This is also due to the sheer amount of classes. I plan to revive this project, knowing way more than I did in my tender school time.
