# FoodSpotter (2019)
A web application that applies image classification to identify foodstuffs (70 classes). Made using HTML, CSS, JS and Python.
Allegedly, it has an accuracy of 46.497%. I'm not too sure about that, since it keeps thinking things are miso soup. 
I plan to revive this project, knowing way more than I did in my school days.
